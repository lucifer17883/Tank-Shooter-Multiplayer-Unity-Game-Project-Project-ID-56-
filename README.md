# Tank-Shooter-Multiplayer-Unity-Game-Project-Project-ID-56-

I have learned a lot of things in this project so far. I am currently trying to add extra features and implement multiplayer into the game. The game is half baked right now but I have decided to create artwork and add sound at the last. I have only included the Assets folder from the Project folder as the files are too big and the Assets folder contain all the stuff I have created. About the things I learned, here they are:

(1) Created a Flappy Bird Game from Scratch in Unity

(2) Learned how to use the Input System in Unity

(3) Learned how to take the movement in Unity for the tank to the next level (Coding this for really hard)

(4) Learning how to add multiplayer to the game.

If you want to use the Assets, create a new project on Unity and paste the files in there and it should work.
